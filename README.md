Constructed a synthesizable matrix-vector multiplier unit for neural network layer with ARMâ€™s AXI4-Stream Interconnect protocol
Boosted throughput by 3x and increased frequency by 1.2x by introducing data parallelism and pipelining.
The design exhibits superior throughput performance as matrix dimensions increase. Tested the design using linear test benches and randomization with 100 percent functional coverage
